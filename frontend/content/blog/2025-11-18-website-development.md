After months of off-and-on development work jamming React components into this Hugo website, it's clear that it will be better for the longterm to 
rewrite this site as a NextJS app. This approach will hopefully maintain the static website performance while being far easier to develop and use. 
Another consideration is a desire to use a database for show, venue, and account data. There's only so much that can be done if all the data is living in markdown files. That's great for blogs, but less great for a site like this.

Looking ahead, I'd love to add the following features:
- User show submissions
- Save shows to your own list
- More cities
- Community pages with links to local music scene highlights (record stores, venues, labels, etc.)
- ??

In the meantime, more shows will be added soon.
