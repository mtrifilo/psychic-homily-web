[Winter](https://instagram.com/daydreamingwinter) and [Hooky](https://instagram.com/h0o0ky) have a new collaborative EP called _Water Season_ out now on Julia's War Recordings. Thick with playful effects and recording experiments, this reminds me of a lot of my favorite experimental indie sounds from the early 2000's I thought I'd never hear again in modern music. Tastefully psychedelic, warbly, and addictive thanks to [Winter](https://instagram.com/daydreamingwinter)'s beautiful hooks melding into the hypnotic production conjurings of [Hooky](https://instagram.com/h0o0ky). I'm not sure what contributions each made to the songs, but it sounds wonderful, and they produced something beautiful and new together that's distinct from their solo projects. Clocking in at 8 minutes and 46 seconds, it's well worth a few listens. This may inspire you to dust off some old effect pedals and a tape recorder you've been neglecting.
