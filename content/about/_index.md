The goal of this website is to document and amplify some of the most exciting and memorable new music releases, shows, and cultural events from Arizona musicians and beyond, focusing on artists truly putting their hearts and souls into their work bravely. While Arizona artists will take precedence, any notable releases and events beyond Arizona will be featured as well. We're all in this together.

If you're looking for good shows, the Shows page will be updated often with new shows and venues around the Southwest that will be well-worth your time.
